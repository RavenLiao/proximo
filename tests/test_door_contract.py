"""The door contract: the interface a client builds against is the door that ships.

`docs/door-contract.json` is the six tools as `tools/list` hands them over and the shapes their
answers take. A client built against contract N must meet contract N, so a door that drifts is red
here until the change is made on purpose (`scripts/gen_door_contract.py --bump`), and a contract
the CHANGELOG does not announce is red too: the CHANGELOG is where a client learns the door moved.
